\usage{
score_model_out(
  model_out_tbl,
  target_observations,
  metrics = NULL,
  summarize = TRUE,
  by = "model_id",
  output_type_id_order = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model_out_tbl}{Model output tibble with predictions}

\item{target_observations}{Observed 'ground truth' data to be compared to
predictions}

\item{metrics}{Character vector of scoring metrics to compute. If \code{NULL}
(the default), appropriate metrics are chosen automatically. See details
for more.}

\item{summarize}{Boolean indicator of whether summaries of forecast scores
should be computed. Defaults to \code{TRUE}.}

\item{by}{Character vector naming columns to summarize by. For example,
specifying \code{by = "model_id"} (the default) will compute average scores for
each model.}

\item{output_type_id_order}{For ordinal variables in pmf format, this is a
vector of levels for pmf forecasts, in increasing order of the levels. For
all other output types, this is ignored.}
}
\value{
A data.table with scores
}
\description{
Scores model outputs with a single \code{output_type} against observed data.
}
\details{
Default metrics are provided by the \code{scoringutils} package. You can select
metrics by passing in a character vector of metric names to the \code{metrics}
argument.

The following metrics can be selected (all are used by default) for the
different \code{output_type}s:

\strong{Quantile forecasts:} (\code{output_type == "quantile"})
\itemize{
\item wis
\item overprediction
\item underprediction
\item dispersion
\item bias
\item interval_coverage_deviation
\item ae_median
\item "interval_coverage_XX": interval coverage at the "XX" level. For example,
"interval_coverage_95" is the 95\% interval coverage rate, which would be calculated
based on quantiles at the probability levels 0.025 and 0.975.
}

See \link[scoringutils:get_metrics.forecast_quantile]{scoringutils::get_metrics.forecast_quantile} for details.

\strong{Nominal forecasts:} (\code{output_type == "pmf"} and \code{output_type_id_order} is \code{NULL})
\itemize{
\item log_score
}

(scoring for ordinal forecasts will be added in the future).

See \link[scoringutils:get_metrics.forecast_nominal]{scoringutils::get_metrics.forecast_nominal} for details.

\strong{Median forecasts:} (\code{output_type == "median"})
\itemize{
\item ae_point: absolute error of the point forecast (recommended for the median, see Gneiting (2011))
}

See \link[scoringutils:get_metrics.forecast_point]{scoringutils::get_metrics.forecast_point} for details.

\strong{Mean forecasts:} (\code{output_type == "mean"})
\itemize{
\item \code{se_point}: squared error of the point forecast (recommended for the mean, see Gneiting (2011))
}
