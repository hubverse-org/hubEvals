# Transform pmf model output into a forecast object

Transform pmf model output into a forecast object

## Usage

``` r
transform_pmf_model_out(
  model_out_tbl,
  oracle_output,
  output_type_id_order = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- model_out_tbl:

  Model output tibble with predictions

- oracle_output:

  Predictions that would have been generated by an oracle model that
  knew the observed target data values in advance

- output_type_id_order:

  For ordinal variables in pmf format, this is a vector of levels for
  pmf forecasts, in increasing order of the levels. The order of the
  values for the output_type_id can be found by referencing the hub's
  tasks.json configuration file. For all output types other than pmf,
  this is ignored.

## Value
